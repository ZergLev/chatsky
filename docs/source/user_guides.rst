:doc:`Basic conceptions <./user_guides/basic_conceptions>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``basic conceptions`` tutorial the basics of DFF are described,
those include but are not limited to: dialog graph creation, specifying start and fallback nodes,
setting transitions and conditions, using ``Context`` object in order to receive information
about current script execution.

:doc:`Slot extraction <./user_guides/slot_extraction>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``slot extraction`` tutorial demonstrates the slot extraction functionality
currently integrated in the library. ``DFF`` only provides basic building blocks for this task,
which can be trivially extended to support any NLU engine or slot extraction model
of your liking.
