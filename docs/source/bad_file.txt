Hello! This file should be removed if you see it and not added into the Sphinx Multiversion PR.
Building attempt 1: succeeded, but wrong output directory on gh-pages.
Building attempt 2: Failed to declare recurive directory creation, also found python script mistake, fixed both.
Building attempt 3: Bash didn't recognize the "(" symbol. Oh well, guess I'll do two different deploys. It's the same in terms of space.
Building attempt 18.10.2024: A long time has passed, I just want to know if this will build at all from PR.
Building attempt 5: It didn't build due to a mistake in drawio builds for PRs, fixed. Building again...
Building attempt 23.10.2024: Well, now it's not building because there were lots of changes and also potential issues I ignored when initially created Sphinx Multiversion PR. Building again...
